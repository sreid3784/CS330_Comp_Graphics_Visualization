How do I approach designing software?

I first start with the end in mind and then work backwards from there. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Keeping things simple is a great place to start. I realized my initial proposal was much more difficult to actually code than what i ended up with. 


What design process did you follow for your project work?
It was an iterative process that spanned multiple weeks and versions. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It helps me be able to make a reality of ideas I have about ways to solve problems, remove manual work, and build applications for all to use.
